            We all know that that some of our common used words, and even expressions take their origin in Latin or Ancient Greek, like 'Carpe diem' for example. Apart from showing how our languages and words were built, these etymological relationships can hide much more than you think. This might be common knowledge to linguists, or avid users of Wikitionnary, but there is more to the words we use everyday. This is why we built an interactive visualizazion about etymology.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before getting into these secrets, let's remind ourselves of the general setting. Our world has seen many languages come and go, and are widely distributed around our globe. The small visualization below will let you explore the languages we will be discussing here.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <iframe id="frame-all" src="/" width="750" height="400" frameborder="0">
                <img src="img/story/languages_and_regions.png" alt="Languages and regions">
            </iframe>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Now we are going to get a bit more specific. As mentioned in the introduction, we know that most European languages are heavily influenced by Latin. But are they acutally all directly related to Latin?  Which ones are not? The map below will show you exactly this. You'll quickly notice how practically none of the Asian languages are related to Latin. Already this information hints to the historical separation of these two regions, there is definitely more information to these words than their meaning!
            <br>
            Actually, the links on this map show both kinds of relationships - the languages which were influenced by Latin and those which influenced Latin. Don't hesitate to click around and see this information for other languages than Latin.
        </p>

            <iframe id="frame-lat" src="/" width="750" height="400" frameborder="0">
                <img src="img/story/latin_everywhere.png" alt="Latin everywhere">
            </iframe>
            <script type="application/javascript">
              {
                function load() {
                  setTimeout(function() {
                    var viz = document.getElementById('frame-lat').contentWindow.viz;
                    if (viz && viz.latinExample) {
                      viz.latinExample();
                    } else {
                      load()
                    }
                  }, 50)
                }
                load();
              }
            </script>
        </figure>

        <p>
            We can now look a bit deeper into the data, namely a specific relationship between two languages....
        </p>

        <p>
            The remaining part to explore are the etymological trees of words. These are all the words which are etymologically derived from a given word or the etymoloigcal origin of it. We've handpicked an interesting first one for you: the tomato! We know it doesn't seem like it, but just bear with us for a moment here. As you can see on the graph below, the word "tomato" in english is derived from the Spanish "tomate" which is itself derived from the Classical Nahuatl "tomatl". Classical Nahuatl is also known as Aztec. If you now click on the node for "tomatl", you'll notice how it is the origin of practically every language's word for tomato and more importantly that the tree starts growing from the Spanish word "tomate". This is a clear effect of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, specifically the Spanish conquest of the Aztec during the 16th-century.
            <br>
            You should see a similar behaviour when looking at the word English word avocado. There are plenty more of these examples,

            The information etymology hides is much greater then what appears  at first sight. It's time for you to <a href="https://etymap.xyz/">continue</a> on your own.
