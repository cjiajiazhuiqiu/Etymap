As part of the process book, we will now describe and discuss our initial wireframe and the motivations behind each decision that went into making it. Of course, this only serves as a starting point. The closer we will get to a functional prototype, the more we will learn and understand about our dataset and how our visualization shows its features. The future insights we will gain, will therefore most likely change the visulaization from the wireframe we describe here.

There are two main aspects of the data that we want to show. The first one being how languages relate to eachother at etymologically, and the second one is at a finer grain, namely the etymological tree of specific words. This already plays nicely into the "context and detail" principle, since it allows the user to see these two different levels of the data.

The core component of our visualization is a map. This has the added value of giving geographical information for these relationships. It could therefore potentially show how languages moved with time. The other obvious approach would be a graph, however it would make it much harder for the end-user to search for a specific language/word. There are a  few downfalls of the map, namely the fact that certain areas have a much higher density of languages than others, hence making the vizulation possibly cluttered. Additionaly, certain languages may be spoken across several disjoint areas making the georaphical information either hard to read or ambiguous. 
As of now, we decided on using a map as it gives an initial structure to the underlying graph and can be removed if the previous mentionned pitfalls, or those to come, are clearly detrimental to the visualization.
